## Results Folder

This folder stores files from the **augmentation ranking** experiment during the evolution of the training procedure.
To run the experiment, it is necessary to run the **train.py** file (instructions on how to run it are in the README file inside the root folder).

By default, the experiment is ran every 50 epochs. 

The files in here contain the experiment results in a train-test environment. The results shown in the paper are from a cross-validation training format, from which the mean and the standard deviation were taken.
